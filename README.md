#Angular Podcast App - Server

A Nodejs Rest API to serve the Angular Podcast App.


### Build the app

- execute `npm run build` from a terminal window


## Getting TypeScript
TypeScript itself is simple to add to any project with `npm`.
```
npm install -D typescript
```

### Running the build


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `tslint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Mocha test runner                                                                 |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                 |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `tslint`                  | Runs TSLint on project files                                                                       |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                               |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                   |


### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.


### Running TSLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke TSLint.
To run TSLint you can call the main build script or just the TSLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including TSLint
npm run tslint  // runs only TSLint
```
